# Welcome to CloudPambi's GitHub

Hello there!
I'm a curious newcomer navigating the vast world of coding and open-source.
Here, you'll find small but earnest experiments, beginner-friendly projects, and a growing collection of lessons learned along the way.  

**Learning Focus**  
Currently diving into Web Development Every line of code is a step closer to understanding the art of building things that matter.  

**Goals**  
- Grow as a developer, one commit at a time.  
- Contribute to open-source communities that inspire me.  
- Always stay curious, humble, and open to learning.  

If you're passing by, feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or simply say hello!
